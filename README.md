WOWZERS is a basic 2d game where there are obstacles moving in sinusodal patterns towards the player, and the player must avoid these obstacles and acheive a high score while the game gets progressively harder.
(Game idea originally from Goodgis: https://www.youtube.com/@Goodgis)

This game was made using the LOVE2D framework, and also utilizes the windfield physics module (https://github.com/a327ex/windfield).
The background shader was modified from one found a shadertoy.com (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXtBRr).
Love.js (https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js) was used to build the game to webgl (Although, my build is not very stable).

You can play/download the game on WOWZERS: LOVE EDITION's itch.io page (https://chenzodevo.itch.io/wowzers-love-edition).
